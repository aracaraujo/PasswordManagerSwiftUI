# Overview

On this project I built a password manager. The intent of this project was to learn how to use SwiftUI and Firebase. 
The iOS mobile was written in SwiftUI and is connected to a Firebase database to store data and perform the user 
authentication process.

The app has an authentication system that will allow users to create accounts. Once a user creates an account, 
they can create records that will store their accounts username and password. All the data and the authentication 
process are stored in a Firebase database.


The link bellow is a demonstration of the app running.

# Development Environment

Since the app was developed for iOS I used XCode as my IDE.

The app was written in Swift using the SwiftUI framework for app development.

The links bellow are links that helped me to build my program. On the links bellow you can find documentation to on Swift and SwiftUI. 
Thereâ€™s also the documentation from Google of connecting your iOS app with Firebase. There are also two links of YouTube channels that 
helped me to learn how to work with SwiftUI.
